\section{Discussion}

Inference challenges need to be solved: 1) Not fast enough, how to make EM fast? How to decompose the EM problem into incremental parts? 2) Not robust enough, need testing with real world and see failure modes.

An experimental evaluation protocol: most data related to SLAM will or should have ground truth. To evaluate, compare with the ground truth to determine if  the result is accurate enough. Examine the internals of EM, log-likelihood of each iteration, chi-square test to verify the internal correctness.
