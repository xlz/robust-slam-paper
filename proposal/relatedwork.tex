\section{Related Work}

In SLAM-DATMO, the authors developed a Bayesian framework to solve the SLAM
together with detection and tracking of moving objects. They employed
sophisticated object detection and tracking and data association algorithms to
model object motion. This approach is suitable for the kind of data such as
dense pointclouds produced by laser scanners for the purpose of obtaining fast
and accurate estimation of motion. However, in the case of sparse landmarks or
features generated by visual sensors, there is usually less than sufficient
data to achieve the same level of performance in object detection and
tracking.  Moreover, object detection and tracking is not a part of the SLAM
framework per se, instead it is used as a preprocessing filter to remove
moving objects from the input of the SLAM framework. And maintaining motion
models of moving objects is finally not relevant to the goal of just
estimating the robot trajectory and the still part of the map.


\{mni\} To gain robustness against false positive loop closures, the
switchable constraints approach allows the optimizer to be able to naturally
change the topological structure of the problem during the optimization
itself, which significantly increases the robustness against outliers of the
whole SLAM system and closes the gap between the front-end and the back-end.
This way, edges representing outlier constraints can be removed from the graph
during the optimization. This is achieved by augmenting the original problem
and introducing an additional type of hidden variable: A switch variable is
associated with each factor that could potential represent an outlier. This
additional variable acts as a multiplicative scaling factor on the information
matrix associated with that constraint. Depending on the state of the switch
variable (a value between 0 and 1), the resulting information matrix is either
the original matrix (when the switch is equal to 1) or 0 (when the switch is
0) or something between both ends. Notice that if the switch variable is equal
to 0, the associated constraint is completely removed and has no influence on
the overall solution. 

Since in pose graph SLAM, every loop closure factor could be an outlier, we
associate each loop closure edge with one of the newly introduced switch
variables. With the switchable constraints, the optimization therefore works
on an augmented problem, searching for the joint optimal configuration of the
original variables and the newly introduced switch variables, here searching
the optimal graph topology.
