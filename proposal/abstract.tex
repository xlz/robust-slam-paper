Recent developments in human-robot interaction bring about higher requirements
for robot navigation. Existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms have become unsuited for navigation in complex dynamic
environments due to presumptions of static environments or exceeding
computational limitations. In this paper we propose a new graph SLAM framework
exploring incremental EM algorithms to maintain a reference frame while
establishing the estimations of robot trajectory and the map in real-time. We
plan to evaluate the performance of existing robust SLAM algorithms as baselines,
and validate the improvement of our new framework against datasets of dynamic
environments with moving objects.
