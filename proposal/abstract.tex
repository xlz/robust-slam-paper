Recent development in human-robot interaction brings about higher requirements
for robot navigation. Existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
approaches have become unsuited for navigation in dynamic, complex
environments because of either assumptions about static environments or
computational limitations. In this paper we propose a new graph SLAM framework
exploring incremental EM algorithms to maintain a reference frame while
establishing the estimation of robot trajectory and the map in real-time. We
plan to evaluate the performance of existing robust SLAM algorithms as baselines,
and validate the improvement of our new framework against datasets of dynamic
environments with moving objects.
