\section{Timeline}
\paragraph{11/10 - 11/16} Learning and confirm the exact data structure we'll be handling for each variables in our SLAM model, including parsing the .g2o files\cite{g2o} used by many SLAM algorithms.
\paragraph{11/17 - 11/23} Try using visual cues to cluster the landmarks. Try to design particle filter algorithms or other incremental algorithms to estimate $w_k$
\paragraph{11/24 - 11/30} Implementing the algorithms and experiment on datasets.
\paragraph{12/1 - 12/7} Continue implementing the algorithms and experiment on datasets.
\paragraph{12/8 - 12/14} Finish up the write-up and  experiment.
