% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

%A clear description of the problem or application you intend to address. Why is it worth studying?
%A discussion of related work, including references to at least three relevant research articles or technical reports. Which aspects of your project are novel?
%A figure illustrating a preliminary experiment with some data related to your project. This could be some sort of visualization of the raw data, or the results of running a simple (supervised or unsupervised) machine learning method.
%A description of the learning and/or inference challenges that you need to solve to apply a graphical model to your data. It is fine if you do not yet know what algorithms are appropriate, but discuss the challenges that need to be solved.
%An experimental evaluation protocol. How will you know that you've succeeded?
%A concrete timeline for accomplishing your project by the end of the course. What are the biggest challenges?
