Recent development in human-robot interaction brings about higher requirements
for robot navigation. Existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms have become unsuited for navigation in complex dynamic environments
due to presumptions of static environments or exceeding computational
limitations. In this paper we propose a new robust graph SLAM framework
exploring EM algorithms to characterize landmark mobility while establishing the
estimations of robot trajectory and the map. We evaluate the performance of
existing robust SLAM algorithms as baselines, and validate the improvement of
our new framework against datasets of dynamic environments with moving
landmarks.
